The picture used in this blog was created using the Nightcafe tool. It uses the keywords of artifical intelligence and writing blogs.

There are many practical applications of using AI to build images, such as needing things with particular aesthetics or simply as filler content for projects ranging from professional, to informal, to hobbying. These images could be used as a potential replacement for stock photos, or to add ambience to a tabletop roleplaying game session.

The tool is simple to use. You input a word or phrase, or a collection of words, and the program will generate an image based on that. People with a paid account or credits, which I do not have, have further options once the image is generated to refine it so that it matches what you are looking for. This is the same process as a lot of machine learning programs, in that it learns the more data it is given.

The ethical considerations for AI images are immense, however. A lot of these AI programs base their styles and algorithms on art that is fed to it. A lot of that art though is not used with the permission of the artists. In fact a lot of times the artist has specifically asked for their work to not be used in such a way. This is in effect stealing art and modifying it. It also means that the artist wonâ€™t be paid for their work. As many artists are already struggling and often come from marginalized backgrounds, the AI becomes a way for hegemonic forces to express greater control over those groups.
